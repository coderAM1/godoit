# Current Plan

## Current Priorities

1. implement postgres sql support
2. from knowledge gained from implementing postgres sql support, modify base logic to better support needed operations
3. comment code so logic is as clear as possible
4. include interfaces of how things should function to allow users to support needed use-case but always offer defaults
5. add mongodb support
6. clean up code and optimize
7. add testing to ensure code works as intended and can handle edge scenarios

## Future priorities

- support more db's
- continue to clean and optimize code
- handle bugs as they come up and inspect code to preemptively prevent issues
- setup ci/cd
